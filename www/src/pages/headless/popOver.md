## Basic Example

A PopOver is generated by the factory function `popOver`.

By clicking on the building block created by `popOverButton` or [[Space]] with focused `popOverButton`, the
floating container created by `popOverPanel` is shown as well.

[[Esc]] or a click outside the visible container closes the `popOverPanel`.

```kotlin
data class Solution(val name: String, val description: String, val icon: String)

val solutions = listOf(
    Solution("Insights", "Measure actions your users take", HeroIcons.academic_cap),
    Solution("Automations", "Create your own targeted content", HeroIcons.adjustments),
    Solution("Reports", "Keep track of your growth", HeroIcons.archive)
)

popOver {
    popOverButton {
        span { +"Solutions" }
    }

    popOverPanel {
        solutions.forEach { item ->
            a {
                div {
                    svg { content(item.icon) }
                }
                div {
                    p { +item.name }
                    p { +item.description }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Open State

PopOver is an [`OpenClose` component](#closable-content---openclose). There are different `Flow`s and `Handler`
like `opened` in its scope available to control the open state of a popover panel on state changes.

The opening state of the PopOver can be bound to an external `store` via data binding, e.g. to always display the
popover panel.

```kotlin
popOverButton {
    className(opened.map { if (it) "" else "text-opacity-90" })
    span { +"Solutions" }
}
```

## Transitions

Showing and hiding the popover panel can be easily animated with the help of `transition`:

```kotlin
popOverPanel {
    transition(
        opened,
        "transition ease-out duration-200",
        "opacity-0 translate-y-1",
        "opacity-100 translate-y-0",
        "transition ease-in duration-150",
        "opacity-100 translate-y-0",
        "opacity-0 translate-y-1"
    )

    //...    
}
```

## Positioning

`popOverPanel` is a [`PopUpPanel`](#floating-content---popuppanel) and therefore provides in its scope some
configuration options, e.g. to control the position or distance of the list box from the `popOverButton`
as a reference element:

```kotlin
popOverPanel {
    placement = Placement.Bottom
    distance = 20
    
    //...
}
```

## Arrow

An arrow pointing to the `popOverButton` can easily be added and styled if needed:

```kotlin
popOverPanel {
    arrow("h-3 w-3 bg-white")

    //...
}
```

## Focus Management

In order to prevent interaction with the rest of the application via keyboard interaction, the popover uses a
so-called focus trap by default. Therefore, the focus will cycle through all the focusable elements using [[Tab]]
without leaving the modal panel.

For this reason there should always be at least one focusable element in the popover panel.

By default, the first focusable element is always given the focus. In order to focus a specific tag initially,
the `setInitialFocus` function can be called inside a `Tag`.

## Mouse Interaction

A click on the `popOverButton` toggles the state of the container. A click outside the opened container closes it.

## Keyboard Interaction

| Command                                             | Description      |
|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| [[Enter]] [[Space]] when `popOverButton` is focused | Opens container  |
| [[Esc]] when container is open                      | Closes container |

### Summary / Sketch

```kotlin
popOver {
    // inherited by `OpenClose`
    val openState: DatabindingProperty<Boolean>
    val opened: Flow<Boolean>
    val close: SimpleHandler<Unit>
    val open: SimpleHandler<Unit>
    val toggle: SimpleHandler<Unit>

    popOverButton() { }
    popOverPanel() {
        // inherited by `PopUpPanel`
        var placement: Placement
        var strategy: Strategy
        var flip: Boolean
        var skidding: Int
        var distance: int
    }
}
```

### popOver

Parameters: `classes`, `id`, `scope`, `tag`, `initialize`

Default-Tag: `div`

| Scope property        | Typ                            | Description                                                                                                                  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `openState`           | `DatabindingProperty<Boolean>` | Mandatory (two-way) data-binding for opening and closing.                                                                    |
| `opened`              | `Flow<Boolean>`                | Data stream that provides Boolean values related to the "open" state. Quite useless within a popover, as it is always `true` |
| `close`               | `SimpleHandler<Unit>`          | Handler to close the popover panel from inside.                                                                              |
| `open`                | `SimpleHandler<Unit>`          | handler to open; does not make sense to use within a popover!                                                                |
| `toggle`              | `SimpleHandler<Unit>`          | handler for switching between open and closed; does not make sense to use within a popover.                                  |

Default-Tag: `button`

### popOverPanel

Available in the scope of: `popOver`

Parameters: `classes`, `scope`, `tag`, `initialize`

Default-Tag: `div`

| Scope property | Typ         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|----------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `placement`    | `Placement` | Defines the position of the building block, e.g. `Placement.top`, `Placement.bottomRight`, etc. Default is `Placement.auto`. The presumably best position is determined automatically based on the available visible space.  |
| `strategy`     | `Strategy`  | Determines whether the block should be positioned `absolute` (default) or `fixed`.                                                                                                                                           |
| `flip`         | `Boolean`   | If the block comes too close to the edge of the visible area, the position automatically changes to the other side if more space is available there.                                                                         |
| `skidding`     | `Int`       | Defines the distance of the selection list from the reference element in pixels. The default value is 10.                                                                                                                    |
| `distance`     | `Int`       | Defines the movement of the selection list along the reference element in pixels. The default value is 0.                                                                                                                    |
