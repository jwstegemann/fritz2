teaser: "A list box offers the user the opportunity to select an option from a given set. The selection options are
normally only visible when the list box is active."

## Basic Example

A list box is created by the factory function `fun <T> listbox()`. `T` is the data type of the choices to be offered,
such as a domain data type like movie characters.

By clicking on the building block created by `listboxButton` or [[Space]] with focused `listboxButton`, the selection
list is displayed. The `listboxButton` often shows the currently selected item.

It is mandatory to specify a data stream or a store of type `T` as data binding via the `value` property. The component
supports two-way-data-binding, i.e. it reflects a selected element from the outside by a `Flow<T>`
but also emits the updated selection to the outside by some `Handler`.

You can navigate within the selection list using the keyboard. By [[Enter]], [[Space]] or a mouse click an item is
selected. If the list box loses focus or the user clicks outside the selection list, ths box is hidden.

The selection list is generated by the `listboxItems` block factory. Within this scope the individual options are
defined by `listboxItem`, which receives as the first parameter the value that represents this option. A typical pattern
is therefore the use of a loop in which this factory function is called accordingly.

::: warning
**Beware:** Entries cannot be removed from the list box. Once an entry is added to the list by `listboxItem`,
it will remain inside forever. So never use some reactive pattern for populating the list box as some `Flow<List<T>>`
combined with some call to `renderEach` or alike!

If the entries change, you must re-render the whole component.
:::

```kotlin
// some domain type for this example, a collection to choose from, and an external store
val characters = listOf("Luke", "Leia", "Han",)
val bestCharacter = storeOf("Luke")

listbox<String> {
    // set up (two-way-)data-binding
    value(bestCharacter)
    
    listboxButton {
        span { value.data.renderText() }
        svg { content(HeroIcons.selector) }
    }

    listboxItems {
        // using a loop is a typical pattern to create the options
        characters.forEach { entry ->
            listboxItem(entry) { // needs to be created for each selectable option
                span { +entry }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Styling the active or selected Item 

A `listboxItem` has two special states:

- if the item was navigated to by keyboard or mouse movement, it is `active`.
- A click, [[Enter]] or [[Space]] select the active. It is then `selected`.

In the scope of a `listboxItem`, `active` and `selected` are available as `Flow<Boolean>` to apply styling or to render
or hide certain elements accordingly to the state:

```kotlin
listboxItem(entry) {
    //change fore- und background-color is item is active 
    className(active.map {
        if (it) "text-amber-900 bg-amber-100" else "text-gray-300"
    })
    
    span { +entry }

    //render checked-icon only if item is selected
    selected.render {
        if (it) {
            svg { content(HeroIcons.check) }
        }
    }
}
```

## Disable Items

The individual items in the selection list can be disabled statically or dynamically. In the scope of a `listboxItem`
the `Handler<Boolean>` `disable` is available for this. It can be called up directly or used to dynamically set the
disabled status of an item depending on an external data flow. The disabled state of the item is also available
as `Flow<Boolean>` to style the item depending on it, for example.

```kotlin
val characters = listOf(
    "Luke" to true,
    "Leia" to false,
    "Chewbakka" to false,
    "Han" to false
)
    
val bestCharacter = storeOf("Luke")
    
listbox<String> {
    value(bestCharacter)
    
    //...

    listboxItems {
        characters.forEach { (entry, disabledState) ->
            listboxItem(entry) {
                //set disabled state
                disable(disabledState)
                
                //change text-color if item is disabled
                className(disabled.map {
                    if (it) "text-gray-300" else "text-gray-800"
                })

                span { +entry }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Add a Label

The list box can be supplemented with a label using `listboxLabel`, e.g. for use in forms or for a screen reader:

```kotlin
listbox<String> {
    //...
    listboxLabel {
        span { +"select best character of franchise" }
    }
    //...
}
```

## Open State

Listbox is an [`OpenClose` component](#closable-content---openclose). There are different `flow`s and `Handler`
like `opened` in its scope available to control the open state of a list box based on state changes.

The opening state of the list box can be bound to an external `store` via data binding, e.g. to always display the list
box.

## Transitions

Showing and hiding the selection list can be easily animated with the help of `transition`:

```kotlin
listboxItems {
    transition(opened,
        enter = "transition duration-100 ease-out",
        enterStart = "opacity-0 scale-95",
        enterEnd = "opacity-100 scale-100",
        leave = "transition duration-100 ease-in",
        leaveStart = "opacity-100 scale-100",
        leaveEnde = "opacity-0 scale-95"
    )
    
    characters.forEach { (entry, disabledState) ->
        listboxItem(entry) {
            //...
        }
    }
}
```

## Positioning

`listboxItems` is a [`PopUpPanel`](#floating-content---popuppanel) and therefore provides in its scope some
configuration options, e.g. to control the position or distance of the list box from the `listboxButton`
as a reference element:

```kotlin
listboxItems {
    placement = Placement.Top
    distance = 20
    
    characters.forEach { (entry, disabledState) ->
        listboxItem(entry) {
            //...
        }
    }
}
```

## Validation

Data binding allows the Listbox component to grab the validation messages and provide its own building
block `listboxValidationMessages` that is only rendered when there are some messages. These messages are exposed within
its scope as a data stream `msgs`.

```kotlin
listbox<String> {
    value(bestCharacter)
    listboxButton { /* ... */ }

    listboxItems {
        characters.forEach { entry ->
            listboxItem(entry) {
                span { +entry }
            }
        }
    }

    listboxValidationMessages(tag = RenderContext::ul) {
        msgs.renderEach { li { +it.message } }
    }
}
```

## Focus Management

If the selection list of the list box is open, the focus is on the `listboxItems` element. If it loses focus again, the
select list is closed and the focus returns to the `listboxButton`.

## Mouse Interaction

A click on the `listboxButton` toggles the state of the selection list. A click outside the opened selection list closes
this. If the mouse is moved over an item in the open list, it becomes active marked. Clicking on an item when the list
is open selects it and closes the list.

## Keyboard Interaction

|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| [[Enter]] [[Space]] when `listBoxButton` is focused   | Opens listbox and activates current selected item       |
| [[⬆]] [[⬇]] when listbox is open                      | Activates previous / next item                          |
| [[Home]] [[End]] when listbox is open                 | Activates first / last item                             |
| [[A-Z]] [[a-z]] when listbox is open                  | Activates first item beginning with according letter    |
| [[Esc]] when listbox is open                          | Closes listbox                                          |
| [[Enter]] [[Space]] when listbox is open              | Selects active item                                     |

| `selected`     | `Flow<Boolean>`          | This data stream provides the selection state of the managed option: `true` the option is selected, `false` if not.                          |
| `active`       | `Flow<Boolean>`          | This data stream indicates whether an item has focus: `true` the option has focus, `false` if not. Only one option can have focus at a time. |
