## Overview

fritz2 uses stores to manage the application state by holding a data model. But quite often the data does 
not fit into the desired UI-fragment out of the box. This is often due to the normalized form which avoids redundancy 
as much as possible. Also, HTML can only render `Strings` at the end of the day, but the correct `String` representation 
of data types differs from case to case, and we do not want to store those explicitly.

In order to support clean data management and compromise well between data and UI-shape, fritz2's stores 
offer a powerful concept: store mapping.

Remember the `map`-function from collections where a source type `T` is transformed to another type `R`
inside of an expression? We can also *map* a store in order to change its source type to a more suitable type.
However, there is one big difference between the classical `map`-function and the store's mapping functions: A store 
needs both a getter-function from `T -> R` and a setter-function from `R -> T` to manage changes.

### Lenses

If you are unfamiliar with the universal concept for the functionality called *lens* in computer science, take
a look at the [excellent documentation on lenses](https://arrow-kt.io/learn/immutable-data/lens/) from the 
[arrow-project](https://arrow-kt.io) before reading on. We are about to give you a short intro to lenses, and further 
discuss them later in the Essentials section [Lenses in Depth](#lenses-in-depth).

fritz2 offers the method `lensOf()` for a short-and-sweet-experience which accepts a getter- and 
a setter-expression:
```kotlin
val nameLens: Lens<Person, String> = lensOf({ it.name }, { person, value -> person.copy(name = value) })
```

This lens can be used to access the `name`-property of a `Person`, or to create a new person with changed name:
```kotlin
val fritz2 = Person(1, "fritz2")
val nameOfFritz2: String = nameLens.get(person) // nameOfFritz2 = "fritz2"
val hugo: Person = nameLens.set(fritz2, "hugo") // hugo = Person(1, "hugo")
```
As you can see, there is no magic, just plain old function calling.

Let's take a step back and explore how the concept of lenses can be used to map one store to another.

### Mapping Stores Using Lenses

Imagine a use case where the interests of a person are rendered as tags - comma seperated values. They can be changed 
by typing them as CSV.

But in order to further process these interests, it makes more sense to store them in a `List<Interest>`, so that will
be the canonical state representation in our application:
```kotlin
val interestsStore: Store<List<Interest>> = storeOf(emptyList(), job = Job())
```
However, this representation does not fit the requirements of the specific UI-fragment - but no worries! Simply define 
a `Lens` that does the mapping between the list and the `String` based CSV representation:
```kotlin
val interestLens: Lens<List<Interest>, String> = lensOf(
    List<Interest>::joinToString, // getter
    { it.split(",").map { Interest.valueOf(it.trim()) } } // setter
)
```

Armed with this lens, we can map the interest-store and use the resulting store in the UI:
```kotlin
val interestsStore: Store<List<Interest>> = storeOf(emptyList(), job = Job())

val interestLens: Lens<List<Interest>, String> = lensOf(
    List<Interest>::joinToString,
    { it.split(",").map { Interest.valueOf(it.trim()) } }
)

val csvInterests: Store<String> = interestsStore.map(interestLens)
//  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//  Create a new store with the                  Use the `map` function to map the store
//  desired type (2nd of the `Lens`)             and provide the lens for the transformations

render {
    h1 { +"Choose Interests from:" }
    p { +Interest.values().joinToString() }
    input {
        label { +"Interests:" }
        // reactively connect the input to the mapped CSV representation store
        value(csvInterests.data) 
        changes.values() handledBy csvInterests.update
    }
    h1 { +"Chosen Interests:" }
    csvInterests.data.renderText()
    
    // just to demonstrate that the original store is always in sync with the mapped one:
    interestsStore.data handledBy { interests ->
        console.log(interests)
    }
}
```
As you can see, the mapped store fits perfectly to the desired (yet a little artificial) requirements for the UI:
There is no mapping inside the UI, nor are there any custom handlers or data-flows in the store.

But to be fair, the manual creation of the lens is heavy work. So fritz2 offers more tools to make lens generation 
easier, especially for the use case of destructuring complex model types.

## Essentials

### Lenses in Depth

Most of the time, a model for a view will not be of a simple data-type but a complex entity, like a
person having a name, multiple addresses, an email, a date of birth, etc.

In those cases, you will most likely need `Store`s for the properties of your main entity, and - later on - for
the properties of the child-entity like the street in an address in our example from above.

fritz2 again uses `Lens`es to describe the relationship between an entity and its child-entities and
properties.

A `Lens` is basically a way to describe the relation between an outer and inner entity in a structure. It focuses on the
inner entity from the viewpoint of the outer entity, which is how it got its name. Lenses are especially useful when
using immutable data-types like fritz2 does.

A `Lens` needs to handle the following:

* Getting the value of the inner entity from a given instance of the outer entity
* Creating a new instance of the outer entity (immutable!) as a copy of a given one with a different value only for the
  inner entity

In fritz2, a `Lens` is defined by the following interface:
```kotlin
interface Lens<P,T> {
    val id: String
    fun get(parent: P): T
    fun set(parent: P, value: T): P
}
```

All you do to benefit is implement the functions `get()` and `set()`, or use the `lensOf()` function we discussed in
previous sections:

```kotlin
val nameLens = lensOf("name", { it.name }, { person, value -> person.copy(name = value) })
```

No magic there. The first parameter sets an id for the `Lens`. When using `Lens`es with `Store`s,
the `id` will be used to generate a valid HTML `id` representing the path through your model.
This can be used to identify your elements semantically (for validation or automated ui-tests for example).

If you have deep nested structures or a lot of them, you may want to automate this behavior.

fritz2 offers a `@Lenses` annotation you can add to your data-classes, sealed-classes and sealed-interfaces in the 
`commonMain` source-set of your multiplatform project:
```kotlin
@Lenses
data class Person(val name: String, val value: String) {
    companion object // needs to be declared! The generated lens-factories are created within.
}
```
Using an annotation-processor, fritz2 builds factory methods for each public constructor property within the
companion object of the data class from these annotations which contains all the `Lens`es you need.
They are named exactly like the entities and properties, so it's easy to use:

```kotlin
val nameLens = Person.name()
```

You can see it in action at our [nestedmodel-example](/examples/nestedmodel).

Keep in mind that your annotated classes have to be in your `commonMain` source-set,
otherwise the automatic generation of the lenses will not work!

Have a look at the [validation-example](/examples/validation) to see how to set it up.

This will also help you define a multiplatform project for sharing your model and validation code between
the browser and backend.

::: info
There are other lenses generated as well. Especially when dealing with `sealed`-hierarchies, fritz2 offers more
helpful variants that are commonly needed to apply different idioms and patterns like *validation* or holding the base
type in some `Store` for type based UI design.

You can find out more in the two applications described in the sections 
[Dealing with Sealed Type Hierarchies](#dealing-with-sealed-type-hierarchies) 
and [Delegating Validation in Sealed Hierarchies](/docs/validation/#delegating-validation-in-sealed-hierarchies).
:::

### Destructuring Complex Models With Mapped `Store`s and `Lense`s

Having a `Lens` available which points to some specific property makes it very easy to get a `Store` for that
property from an original `Store` of the parent entity:

```kotlin
// given the following nested data classes...
@Lenses
data class Name(val firstname: String, val lastname: String) {
    companion object
}

@Lenses 
data class Person(val name: Name, description: String) {
    companion object
}

// ... you can create a root-store...
val personStore = storeOf(Person(Name("first name", "last name"), "more text"), job = Job())
// ... and a derived store using the automatic generated lens-factory `Person.name()`
val nameStore = personStore.map(Person.name())
```

Now you can use your `nameStore` exactly like any other `Store` to set up _two-way data binding_. Call `map(...)`
again to access the properties of `Name`. If a `Store` contains a `List`, you can of course iterate over it by
using `renderEach()`. It's fully recursive from here on down to the deepest nested parts of your model.

[Remember](/docs/createstores/#extend-none-custom-(local)-stores) that you can also add `Handler`s to your `Store`s 
by simply calling the `handle` method:

```kotlin
val booleanChildStore = parentStore.map(someLens)
val switch = booleanChildStore.handle { model: Boolean -> 
    !model
}

render {
    button {
        +"switch state"
        clicks handledBy switch
    }
}
```

To keep your code well-structured, it is recommended to implement complex logic in your `Store` or inherit it by 
using interfaces. However, the code above is a decent solution for small (convenience-)handlers.

### Calling `map` on a `Store` With Nullable Content

Calling `map` on a nullable `Store` only makes sense when you have checked that its state is not null:

```kotlin
@Lenses
data class Person(val name: String)

//...

val storedPerson = storeOf<Person?>(null, job = Job())

//...

storedPerson.data.render { person ->
    if (person != null) { // Avoid NullPointerExceptions reading or updating storedPerson
                          // by manually creating a safe scope ensuring that person is not null
        val storedName = storedPerson.map(Person.name())
        input {
            value(storedName.data)
            changes.values() handledBy storedName.update
        }
    }
    else {
        p { + "No customer selected" }
    }
}
```

### Handling Nullable States in `Store`s

If you have a `Store` with a nullable state, you can use `mapNull` to derive a non-nullable `Store` from it which 
transparently translates a `null`-value from its parent `Store` to the given default-value and vice versa.

After text is entered into and then removed from the input of the following example, `nameStore` will have a state of
`null`: 

```kotlin
val nameStore = storeOf<String?>(null, job = Job())

render {
    input {
        nameStore.mapNull("").also { formStore ->
            value(formStore.data)
            changes.values() handledBy formStore.update
        }
    }
}
```

In the real world, you will often come across nullable attributes of complex entities. Call `mapNull`
directly on the `Store` you create to use with your form elements:

```kotlin
@Lenses
data class Person(val name: String?)

//...

val personStore = storeOf(Person(null), job = Job())

//...

val nameStore = personStore.map(Person.name()).mapNull("")
```

#### The other way around

You may also encounter special cases where you would like to apply the above-mentioned mapping the other way around:
e.g. when dealing with a non-nullable data model in combination with a nullable data-binding of a component such as a
combobox.

For those cases, use the `mapNullable` mapper function:

```kotlin
val nonNullableStore: Store<String> = storeOf("")

val nullableStore: Store<String?> = 
    nonNullableStore.mapNullable(placeholder = "Unknown")
//                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//                               When the parent has the specified placeholder value,
//                               the mapped Store will have `null` as its value.
```

### Combining Lenses

A `Lens` supports the `plus`-operator with another lens in order to create a new lens which combines the two. 
The `get` and `set`-functions of the resulting lens are chained in natural order.

Imagine the following example:
```kotlin
data class Address(val street: String)
data class Person(val address: Address)

val addressOfPerson: Lens<Person, Address> = lensOf("address", Person::address) { p, v -> p.copy(address = v) }
val streetOfAddress: Lens<Address, String> = lensOf("street", Address::street) { p, v -> p.copy(street = v) }

// combine two lenses:
val streetOfPerson = address + street

// apply the combined lens to an example object:
val person = Person(Address("Lerchenweg"))
streetOfPerson.get(person) // -> "Lerchenweg"
streetOfPerson.set("Rosenstraße") // Person(address = Address("Rosenstraße"))
```

Let's see how this example would work with automatically generated lenses.

```kotlin
@Lenses
data class Address(val street: String) { companion object }

@Lenses
data class Person(val address: Address) { companion object }

val streetOfPerson = Person.address() + Address.street()
```

This works, but the syntax is quite cumbersome, especially for deeper nested models.

fritz2's automatic `@Lenses`-annotation-processor has dedicated support for deeper nested models as well and
creates extension functions for all lenses. This allows you to chain the calls fluently:

```kotlin
@Lenses
data class Address(val street: String) { companion object }

@Lenses
data class Person(val address: Address) { companion object }

val streetOfPerson = Person.address().street()
```
This fluent API looks much terser and cleaner compared to the canonical one above. Note that, under the hood, nothing
special happens - the generated code simply uses the `plus` operator the same way you would.

Combining lenses is also very useful for formatting values, as we shall see in the next section.

### Formatting Values

HTML allows only `String`s in your attributes, for example the `value` attribute of `input {}`. To use other data
types in your model, you have to specify how a type should be represented as `String` (e.g. Number, Currency, Date).
When working with `input {}`, you also need parse the user input back to your data type.
For all Kotlin basic types, there is a convenience function `asString()` which generates a `Lens` from this type to 
`String` and vice versa. It internally calls the `T.toString()` and `String.toT()` functions.

```kotlin
@Lenses
data class Person(val age: Int)

val ageLens: Lens<Person, Int> = Person.age() // cannot be used in tag attributes
val ageLensAsString: Lens<Person, String> = Person.age().asString() // now it is usable
```

Also, remember that you can use the `lensOf()` function to create lenses which we introduced in the lenses section:

```kotlin
fun <P> lensOf(format: (P) -> String, parse: (String) -> P): Lens<P, String>
```

When using other types like `kotlinx.datetime.LocalDate`, special lenses for string conversion need to be specified for them:
```kotlin
import kotlinx.datetime.*

@Lenses
data class Person(val birthday: LocalDate)

object Formats {
    val date: Lens<LocalDate, String> = lensOf(LocalDate::toString, String::toLocalDate)
}
```

Now you can use the `Formats.date` lens for deriving stores:

```kotlin
val personStore = storeOf<Person>(Person(LocalDate(1990, 1, 1)), job = Job())

val birthday: Store<String> = personStore.map(Person.birthday() + Formats.date)
// or when an interim store is needed
val birthday: Store<String> = personStore.map(Person.birthday()).map(Formats.date)
```

Take a look at our complete [validation example](/examples/validation) to get an impression of that topic.

| `Store<T?>.mapNull(default: T): Store<T>`                       | Maps a `Store` of a nullable `T` to a `Store` of a definitely none nullable `T` using a default value in case of `null` in source-store.                                          |
| `Store<T>.mapNullable(placeholder: T): Store<T?>`               | Maps a `Store` of `T` to a `Store` of `T?`, replacing the given `placeholder` from the parent with `null` in the sub Store. This function is the reverse equivalent of `mapNull`. |

## Advanced Topics

### Reactive Rendering of Entity-Lists With Auto-Mapped Element Store

There is a special convenience method for the [reactive rendering](/docs/render/#reactive-rendering) of lists of 
entities which requires some knowledge about `Store`s and `Lens`es.

On a store of `List<T>`, an extension method called `renderEach` is defined directly on the
store. It is mandatory to pass an `idProvider`, so this is targeted to entity-types.

Inside the content-parameter expression of `renderEach`, instead of just `T`, a `Store<T>` gets injected. Some 
store-mapping takes place under the hood: For each element of the original list, a mapped store
handling that element from the original store is created.

```kotlin
val storedPersons: Store<List<Person>> = storeOf(listOf(Person(1, "fritz2", emptySet())), job = Job())

// needed for mapping an already mapped store to destructure the model further 
val nameLens: Lens<Person, String> = lensOf("name", Person::name) { person, name -> person.copy(name = name) }

render {
    div {
        storedPersons.renderEach(Person::id) { storedPerson ->
        //            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        //            call directly on the     get a full `Store<Person>`
        //            store                    for each element
            
            val storedName = storedPerson.map(nameLens) // create this store to map it further
            
            // provide an input element in order to modify one property of that person
            input {
                value(storedName.data)
                changes.values() handledBy storedName.update
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Tables with editable cells are a typical use case for `Store<List<T>>.renderEach`.
Check out the boilerplate code that can be omitted in comparison to using the `Flow<List<T>>.renderEach`-function:

```kotlin
val storedPersons: Store<List<Person>> = storeOf(listOf(Person(1, "fritz2", emptySet())), job = Job())

val nameLens: Lens<Person, String> = lensOf("name", Person::name) { person, name -> person.copy(name = name) }

render {
    div {
        storedPersons.data.renderEach(Person::id) { person -> //  We get a `T`.. 
            
            // ... thus we must create the mapped store manually:
            val storedPerson = storedPersons.mapByElement(person, Person::id)
            
            // the same as above
            val storedName = storedPerson.map(nameLens)
            input {
                value(storedName.data)
                changes.values() handledBy storedName.update
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You might notice that the parameters of `renderEach` and `mapByElement` are identically. That's why it is possible
to encapsulate the store mapping directly into the former presented convenience function.

### Dealing with sealed Type Hierarchies

There are special needs when you integrate `sealed` types into your model. It does not matter whether this is at the
root or nested inside your model-tree. There are always similar idioms that need to be applied. Those idioms need
special lenses, that will be generated by our `lenses-annotation-processor` for you.

Imagine the following example model:
```kotlin
import dev.fritz2.core.Lenses
import dev.fritz2.core.NoLens

@Lenses
sealed interface Wish {
    val label: String
    companion object
}

@Lenses
data class Wishlist(
  val name: String,
  val wishes: List<Wish>
) {
  companion object
}
```

As you can see, we want to model a wishlist, which simply holds a list of wishes.
A `Wish` is a `sealed interface` that defines a `label` for all common children. It is also annotated by the known
`@Lenses`-annotation in order to tell the annotation processor to create lenses for this base type too.

The `WhishList` simply serves as a root node of the model to integrate the sealed hierarchy into another type.

:::info
Our support for sealed type hierarchies has the following restriction:
All children of an annotated sealed base type need to be `data class`es that are themselves annotated with the `@Lenses`
annotation. The annotation processor will fail with an error if this constraint is violated.
:::

There might be different kinds of wishes, though, which all differ in their special properties.
Take those for example:
```kotlin
@Lenses
data class Computer(
    override val label: String,
    val ramInKb: Int
) : Wish {
    companion object
}

enum class Color {
  Blue, Red, Green, Purple, Yellow, Petrol
}

@Lenses
data class LightSaber(
  override val label: String,
  val color: Color
) : Wish {
  companion object
}
```

Our `WhishList.wishes` list can hold arbitrary objects of `Computer` and `LightSaber`, while both types need different
aspects to be well-defined:
- a computer needs RAM - as we refer to the good old homecomputer's era, we store those values in kilobytes.
- a lightsaber needs a color - as fritz2's logo is somewhat *petrol*, we make this possible for our merch.

Look at an example with a `Store` of type `WishList`:
```kotlin
val wishlist = Wishlist(
    "Christmas wishes",
    listOf(
        LightSaber("fritz2", Color.Petrol),
        Computer("C64", 64)
    )
)

val storedWishList: Store<WishList> = storeOf(wishlist)
```

We would like to implement a small UI to manage those wishes. It might look similar to this:
![Wishlist App](/img/sealed-hierarchy-example-app.png)

The overall example is rather good [domain modelling](https://arrow-kt.io/learn/design/domain-modeling/), 
but it imposes some problems when it comes to store-mapping:

1. To map the main model down to the nodes of the tree (`Whislist -> wishes -> some single wish -> Computer -> ramInKb`),
there is the need to map a store of the base type to a specific type. As mapping involves `Lens`es, we need 
a `Lens<Wish, Computer>`, for example. How could this be done?
2. Another difficulty arises by the fact that we also want to modify the *common* properties of the base type.  
There is no implementation, though, so how should we implement the `setter` of a `Lens<Wish, String>` for the
`Whish.label`-property?

There are solutions with simple idioms for those two problems that you can craft by hand. fritz2's lenses
processor creates the needed `Lens`es automatically for you, however.

The following two sections demonstrate the aforementioned solutions.

#### Up-Casting and Down-Casting Lenses

Let us recap the paths we need to take for a store-mapping from top to bottom elements:
- `Whislist -> wishes -> some single wish -> Computer -> ramInKb`
- `Whislist -> wishes -> some single wish -> LightSaber -> color`

We will need the following lenses to realize those mappings:
```kotlin
// Lenses to map to `WhishList`-properties
val name: Lens<WhishList, String> = TODO()
val wishes: Lens<WishList, List<Wish>> = TODO()

// Lenses to map to single `Wish`
val singleWish: Lens<List<Wish>, Wish> = TODO()

// Lenses to map to *specific* child type
// This is das "hard" problem - we need to up-cast from base type to specific type
val computer: Lens<Wish, Computer> = TODO() // how could such an up-casting be implemented?
val lightSaber: Lens<Wish, LightSaber> = TODO()

// Lenses to map to specific `Computer`-properties
val ramInKb: Lens<Computer, Int> = TODO()

// Lenses to map to specific `LightSaber`-properties
val color: Lens<LightSaber, Color> = TODO()
```

The two problematic lenses are the ones that need to implement the up-casting from the base type to the specific type:
- `Lens<Wish, Computer>`
- `Lens<Wish, LightSaber>`

We need to know the specific type which we can typically solve with an appropriate `when`-expression.
Remember the type notation of the `getter`-property of a `Lens<P, T>` is `(P) -> T` which would translate to 
`(Wish) -> Computer` in our example case. To obtain the correct return type, we can simply cast inside the 
`getter`-expression of our `Lens` to the specific type:
```kotlin
val computerLens: Lens<Wish, Computer> = lensOf(
    id = "", // as this Lens does not change the "position" inside the tree, we preserve the overall `path`
    getter = { it as Computer },
    //         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    //         we need the getter to return the correct, specific type!
    //         as we know the type, we can simply cast the object held inside the `wishes`-list
    setter = { _, v -> v }
)
```
As the `setter` has the type notion `(Wish, Computer) -> Wish` we can simply return the value as it is. It already has
the correct specific type.

:::info
Casting from the base type to a more specific type is called up-casting.
Since we apply this to a lens, we call this kind of lens *up-casting* lens.
:::

But beware that the above code behaves still a bit brittle, as we do not cope with casting problems!
That's why fritz2 offers a dedicated lens factory for this use case: `lensForUpcasting`:
```kotlin
val computerLens: Lens<Wish, Computer> = lensForUpcasting<Wish, Computer>()
```
Our automatic lens generator relies on this factory too. So strive to use this, if you craft your up-casting lenses 
manually. 

Armed with such an up-casting lenses, we can easily access or change values of our example `WishList`-object:
```kotlin
val wishlist = Wishlist(
    "Christmas wishes",
    listOf(
        LightSaber("fritz2", Color.Petrol),
        Computer("C64", 64) // index of 1 in list
    )
)

val upcastingLens: Lens<Wish, Computer> = lensForUpcasting<Wish, Computer>()

// craft a lens to access the `Computer.raminKb`-property from a `WishList` by combining the
// intermediate lenses by `+`-operator:
val ramInKbLens: Lens<Wishlist, Int> =
    Wishlist.wishes() + lensForElement(1) + upcastingLens + Computer.ramInKb()
//  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//  |                   |                   |               generated by annotation 
//  |                   |                   |                
//  |                   |                   apply our handcrafted up-casting lens to
//  |                   |                   cast from `Wish` base type to `Computer`
//  |                   |                                     
//  |                   use fritz2's factory for index based lens creation
//  |                   remember that the computer has index `1`!
//  |
//  generated by annotation

val upgradedList = ramInKbLens.set(wishlist, 512)

println(ramInKbLens.get(wishlist)) // prints: 64
println(ramInKbLens.get(upgradedList)) // prints: 512
```

As mentioned before, fritz2's annotation processor will generate those up-casting lenses for you.
They are named after the classname starting with a lowercase letter. Thus, `Computer` will have `computer()` as it's
factory name.

We can now use this to map the `Store` and provide some form elements to change the state:
```kotlin
val storedWishList: Store<WishList> = storeOf(wishlist)
val storedWishes = storedWishList.map(Wishlist.wishes())
storedWishList.data.map { it.wishes.withIndex().toList() }.renderEach { (index, wish) ->
    val storedWish = storedWishes.mapByIndex(index)
    when (wish) {
        is LightSaber -> {
            // we are now safe to up-cast to `LightSaber`-type!
            val storedColor = storedWish.map(Wish.lightSaber().color())
            //                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^
            //                                    use generated up-casting lens
            label {
                +"Color"
                `for`("$index")
            }
            select(id = "$index") {
                changes.values().map { Color.valueOf(it) } handledBy storedColor.update
                Color.entries.forEach { color ->
                    option {
                        value(color.name)
                        selected(storedColor.data.map { it == color })
                        +color.name
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        is Computer -> {
            // we are now safe to up-cast to `Computer`-type!
            val storedRam = storedWish.map(Wish.computer().ramInKb().asString())
            //                                  ^^^^^^^^^^
            //                                  use generated up-casting lens
            label {
                +"RAM (KB)"
                `for`("$index")
            }
            input(id = "$index") {
                type("text")
                value(storedRam.data)
                changes.values() handledBy storedRam.update
            }
        }
    }
}
```

As there may be use-cases where we need to access the other way round, fritz2 also creates so called *down-casting*
lenses for each child of a sealed base type.

Those are lenses, that have a specific type as their parent and the base type as the lens's outcome.
Translated to the example there is a `Lens`-factory created on the type `LightSaber` called `wish()` that looks like 
this:

```kotlin
public fun LightSaber.Companion.wish(): Lens<LightSaber, Wish> = lensOf(
    "",
    { it },
    { _, v -> v as LightSaber }
    //        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    //        because `v`is of type `Wish` we need to cast it "back" into the specific parent type
)
```

#### Delegating Lenses

The second problem of sealed type hierarchies is the access of the *common* properties.

As a sealed base-type is an `interface` or an `abstract class` and *not a* `data class`, there is no `copy()`-function
we could use in order to provide a useful `setter` implementation!

Let us illustrate the problem for the `Wish.label`-property:
```kotlin
val labelLens: Lens<Wish, String> = lensOf(
    id = "label",
    getter = Wish::label, // accessing is easy, but...
    setter = { parent, value -> TODO() }
    //                          ^^^^^^
    //                          ... there is no way to set the value back into the parent!
)
```

There is only one option: We must *delegate* the "work" to the children of the base type. 

Remember: those need to be `data class`es, so we can rely on their `copy()`-capabilities to solve this problem:

```kotlin
val labelLens: Lens<Wish, String> = lensOf(
    id = "label",
    getter = { parent ->
        // separate the different types...
        when(parent) {
            is Computer -> parent.label
            //             ^^^^^^^^^^^^
            //             ... and delegate the access to the child type
            is LightSaber -> parent.label
        }
    },
    setter = { parent, value ->
        // separate the different types...
        when(parent) {
            is Computer -> parent.copy(label = value)
            //                    ^^^^
            //                    ... and delegate the setter work to the child type 
            //                    by calling its `copy`-function.
            is LightSaber -> parent.copy(label = value)
        }
    }
)
```

Because the work is *delegated* to the different child types, we call this kind of lens *delegating lens*.

As this is tedious to write, the fritz2's annotation processor will create those lenses for you. Because it needs to 
be sure it can use the `copy()`-functions, there is the restriction that every child of a sealed base type needs 
to be a `data class`! 

You have already heard about this at the start of top level section, but now you understand the reason for that.

Now we can provide an input-field for the common `label`-property that gets mapped to the appropriate 
child object's field:

```kotlin
val storedWishList: Store<WishList> = storeOf(wishlist)
val storedWishes = storedWishList.map(Wishlist.wishes())
storedWishList.data.map { it.wishes.withIndex().toList() }.renderEach { (index, wish) ->
    val storedWish = storedWishes.mapByIndex(index)
    val storedLabel = storedWish.map(Wish.label())
    //                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^
    //                               use the generated delegating-lens to get
    //                               a store of the common property for each instance
    label {
        +"Label"
        `for`("$index-label")
    }
    input(id = "$index-label") {
        type("text")
        value(storedLabel.data)
        changes.values() handledBy storedLabel.update
    }
}
```

#### Exclude Fields from Lenses Generation

Sometimes you may not want to create a `Lens` for each public field of a sealed base type.
Typical use cases may be properties that should be static for all instances, like some kind of display
name of the type.

For those cases fritz2 offers the `@NoLens`-annotation.

You can simply annotate any public property of a sealed base type to exclude this property from the
automatic lenses generation process.

```kotlin
@Lenses
sealed interface Wish {
    val label: String
    
    // Just annotate a property like this and no (delegating) lens is created
    @NoLens
    val typeName: String
    
    companion object
}

@Lenses
data class Computer(
    override val label: String,
    val ramInKb: Int
) : Wish {
    // cannot be changed, so there is no need for a lens!
    // (and no implementation that would make any sense - no setter possible!)
    override val typeName: String = "Computer"
  
    companion object
}
```
